Elon Musk Suspects Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried Donated Over $1 Billion to Support...,Featured," Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk says that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) probably donated over $1 billion to support the Democratic Party, which would be a much larger sum than the number publicly disclosed. Many people slammed Musk for making accusations without providing proof. “This statement is so unbelievably irresponsible,” one commented.  Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk believes that Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), co-founder and former CEO of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, donated much more than the publicly disclosed amount to support the Democratic Party in elections. Bankman-Fried was the second largest donor to the Democratic Party, after billionaire George Soros, in the 2021-2022 election cycle. According to Opensecrets, he donated $39,884,256 to Democrats before FTX imploded and had to file for bankruptcy. An estimated one million customers and investors lost billions of dollars in the exchange collapse. FTX is currently being investigated for mishandling customer funds. Musk’s statement was in response to a comment on Twitter stating that Bankman-Fried donating $40 million to avoid jail after stealing over $10 billion is one of the highest Return on Investment (ROI) trades of all time. Musk claimed that the $40 million is just the publicly disclosed number, noting that Bankman-Fried’s actual election support of the Democratic Party is “probably” over $1 billion. “The money went somewhere, so where did it go?” the Tesla boss tweeted.  While his donations to the Democratic Party were public knowledge, Bankman-Fried claimed in an interview that he also donated a similar amount to the Republican Party. However, he said all his Republican donations were “dark.” At the time of writing, Musk’s tweet has garnered over 4,500 comments and has been liked over 124,000 times. While some people agreed with the Tesla chief, many were shocked at Musk’s accusations, demanding that the billionaire provide proof to support his statement. “This is literally misinformation,” one exclaimed. Another wrote: “[Musk] baselessly implying SBF broke federal election contribution laws.” A third opined: “Serious accusations by Elon Musk about POTUS accepting stolen funds to run for president.” Some people reminded Musk that Bankman-Fried already explained that he donated the same amount to Republicans. Twitter user Justin Higgins warned: This statement is so unbelievably irresponsible. Musk has now made Twitter an explicitly anti-Democratic Party company. No sensible, corporation that wants solid relations with both parties on Capitol Hill will advertise on Twitter. I can’t see how Twitter ad $ returns… Others simply questioned why SBF is not in jail yet. “We just all can do white-collar crimes and pay people off?” one asked. Many people emphasized that they want politicians to return “stolen” funds they received from the former FTX chief executive. What do you think about Elon Musk’s statement regarding how much Bankman-Fried donated to the Democratic Party? Let us know in the comments section below.

Russia’s Sber Bank Aims for Blockchain Integration With Ethereum and Metamask,Finance," Banking giant Sber wants to integrate its blockchain platform with the Ethereum blockchain and the Metamask wallet. The Russian bank believes the integration will give developers more options and create new opportunities for users when in operations with tokens and smart contracts.  The blockchain platform developed by Sber, Russia’s largest bank, will be technologically compatible with Ethereum, the world’s largest decentralized finance (defi) ecosystem. The financial institution made the announcement during an international meeting with members of the blockchain industry. During the event, organized by the Sber Blockchain Laboratory, the lender explained that the integration will allow developers to freely transfer smart contracts and entire projects between its own blockchain and open blockchain networks. According to a press release, the Sber blockchain will also support an integration with Metamask, a popular crypto wallet used to interact with Ethereum, with which users will be able to perform operations with tokens and smart contracts hosted on the bank’s platform. Sber, formerly known as Sberbank, created its blockchain after receiving authorization from the Central Bank of Russia to operate as an issuer of digital financial assets in March, this year. The platform allows participants to create their own tokens and smart contracts. In September, the bank said it will also permit them to issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The integration with the bank’s information systems makes it possible to order payments under smart contracts in Russian rubles. The platform was originally open only to legal entities, but according to earlier statements, individuals will also be granted access in the last quarter of 2022. “The Sber Blockchain Laboratory works closely with external developers and partner companies, and I am glad that our community will be able to run defi applications on Sber’s infrastructure,” the lab’s Director Alexander Nam was quoted as saying. The executive is convinced that demand for platforms that support various blockchain protocols will increase with the rapid development of Web3. “Sber will be able to unite developers, corporations and financial institutions both in the framework of joint market research and in the course of developing practical business applications,” Nam added. In the past year, Russian authorities have been mulling over a more comprehensive legal framework that will legalize some crypto activities like mining and possibly the use of crypto assets for cross-border payments. During a conference, organized by Sber, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged for the establishment of a new system for international settlements based on blockchain and digital currencies. Do you know of other banks looking to integrate their blockchain platforms with open blockchains? Tell us in the comments section below.

Applied Direct Response — ERCOT Study Shows Bitcoin Mining Is Beneficial to the Texas...,Mining," On Nov. 29, 2022, The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) published a report on seasonal assessment and resource adequacy for the ERCOT region. ERCOT’s study indicates that bitcoin mining operations are flexible operations that can be beneficial to the Texas grid during the upcoming winter and extreme peak load times. The American organization that operates Texas’s electrical grid, ERCOT, has published a study that shows bitcoin mining operations are instrumental in direct response systems. The report’s researchers studied the installed generation capacity based on historical data and extreme peak load scenarios. The report indicates that bitcoin mining operations are able to curtail their operations and relieve roughly 1.7 gigawatts (GW) of energy during the Texas winter. Other systems that leverage large electrical loads are unable to adjust to direct response needs but bitcoin miners, on the other hand, are also known to shut down operations when they reach breakeven price levels between bitcoin’s spot price and cost of production. “This breakeven cost was estimated at $86/MWh and is based on the economics of an Antminer S19 bitcoin mining rig as of early November,” ERCOT’s study details. ERCOT is not the only grid operator that has been studying direct response systems as the second-largest U.S. energy corporation, Duke Energy Corporation, was reportedly studying bitcoin mining in July. Duke’s lead analyst said that bitcoin mining operations partnered with Duke in order to provide data for a bitcoin demand response (DR) study. The same month, the bitcoin mining infrastructure provider Lancium revealed how its operations in Texas can curtail load in DR situations. Lancium teamed up with the Texas battery-storage provider Broad Reach Power LLC, and when the grid is hit with extreme situations, batteries keep Lancium’s facility running without reducing its computational power. Besides heavy load times and extreme weather events, bitcoin miners provide a reliable stream of revenue to the grid’s operators because they are constantly running in search of bitcoins. ERCOT’s study shows that even with bitcoin miners leveraging electrical resources, the grid operators believe there will be a sufficient amount of energy this winter. “Assuming that the ERCOT Region experiences typical winter grid conditions, ERCOT anticipates that there will be sufficient installed generating capacity available to serve the system-wide forecasted peak demand for the upcoming winter season, December 2022 ‒ February 2023,” the report notes. The news follows U.S. legislators pressing ERCOT officials for information concerning bitcoin mining operations. The politicians think that bitcoin mining affects so-called climate change and they think bitcoin miners could possibly destabilize the Texas grid. ERCOT’s new CEO told the press that ERCOT wants “to be able to serve any business that wants to do business in Texas. And that includes crypto miners.” The report from ERCOT shows that politicians are arguably wrong about their grid destabilization predictions, as bitcoin mining facilities may be the only type of operation that can act on DR situations in a matter of no time at all. ERCOT’s 22-page study on seasonal assessment and resource adequacy for the ERCOT region can be read in its entirety here. What do you think about the report published by ERCOT? What do you think about bitcoin mining operations applied to direct response systems? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

"An Unknown Individual Signed a Message Associated With BTC Block 1,018, Reward Was Minted...",News," On Nov. 15, 2022, a post was created on the forum website bitcointalk.org and the thread’s creator asked people to share signatures tied to some of their oldest mined bitcoin blocks. 11 days later, a newly created bitcointalk.org profile, called “Onesignature,” shared a signed message tethered to an extremely old block reward created on Jan. 19, 2009. The key was associated with bitcoin block 1,018 which was created 16 days after Satoshi Nakamoto launched the network. An unknown bitcointalk.org user called “Onesignature,” signed a message tied to bitcoin block 1,018, an extremely old bitcoin block reward that was created on Jan. 19, 2009. The block signing was discovered by the owner of bitcoin.org, the pseudonymous character known as “Cobra.” “A user ‘Onesignature’ has appeared and posted the signature for a key associated with block #1,018,” Cobra tweeted. “For context, there are probably a handful of people in the world who can sign with a Jan. 2009 key,” Cobra added. The bitcointalk.org post shows the user Onesignature’s shared signed message was a bitcoin address that was first seen on Dec. 2, 2022. The BTC address “1E9Yw” has seen a few dust transactions sent to the wallet since the day it was first seen. The signature (HCsBcgB+Wcm8kOGMH8IpNeg0H4gjCrlqwDf/GlSXphZGBYxm0QkKEPhh9DTJRp2IDNUhVr0FhP9qCqo2W0recNM=) is associated with the bitcoin address “1NChf.” The address held the block reward (1,018) in the wallet up until June 14, 2011. Furthermore, one user discovered that the mined coins, transferred in 2011, also had “private keys of addresses that mined earlier than the above-mentioned address.” The people in the post wondered if the user Onesignature was actually Satoshi Nakamoto, but Cobra detailed on Twitter that the address was not a “Patoshi block,” a block associated with Bitcoin’s creator, and remarked that it was “unlikely to be Satoshi.” “While many people *could* have mined Bitcoin that early, the overwhelming evidence suggests that barely anybody did,” Cobra added. “Bitcoin was obscure, irrelevant, and seen as a dumb idea, why install some random .exe?” In Cobra’s Twitter thread, the pseudonymous whistleblower known as “Fatman” said the old address could have been purchased from someone later in time. Fatman shared an old bitcointalk.org screenshot that shows someone noting that “many old keys have been sold or leaked.” Additionally, it was also discovered that a Twitter account exists and it uses the name “@onesignature.” The Twitter account, also named “Andy,” was coincidentally created in October 2009 and the account’s profile image says “don’t trust anyone.” In the bitcointalk.org thread, a user also noted that the signed address was associated with a number of block rewards mentioned and photographed in a Forbes article written by Andy Greenberg. The article is about one of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters, Hal Finney. Bitcointalk.org members also speculated that the address was somehow associated with the now-deceased Bitcoin developer. Replying to Fatman on Friday, Cobra said that if Onesignature did “purchase a Jan 2009 key, they are about to get swamped with massive offers.” “Someone is trying to make a bold statement,” Cobra added. What do you think about Onesignature signing an ancient bitcoin block from 2009? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

"Report: Genesis Owes Gemini Customers $900 Million, Exchange Is Attempting to Recoup Assets",News," According to a recent report from the Financial Times (FT), Genesis Global Capital allegedly owes $900 million to Gemini customers. The exchange operated by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss is attempting to recover the funds from Genesis, according to FT’s sources. FT reports that the centralized crypto asset exchange created by the Winklevoss brothers is owed $900 million and reportedly Genesis Global Capital is the debtor. People familiar with the matter told FT that Gemini was in the process of trying to recover the funds from Genesis and the company’s parent firm Digital Currency Group (DCG). The report further alleges that Genesis is still attempting to solicit funds from investors to ease financial burdens. While reports noted that Genesis was trying to get $1 billion in funding, FT details that it’s been cut down to roughly $500 million. The news follows the report published by Barron’s author Joe Light that noted Genesis is reportedly being probed by state securities regulators. Furthermore, on Nov. 22, 2022, the New York Times (NYT) reported that Genesis Global Capital hired a restructuring adviser. NYT detailed that Moelis & Company was hired by Genesis to “explore options including a potential bankruptcy,” according to three people familiar with the matter. FT’s report about the issues between Genesis and Gemini indicates that FT’s sources say Gemini is in the midst of creating a creditors’ committee. Last month, Gemini revealed that customers using the platform’s Earn program could not withdraw funds. “We are working with the Genesis team to help customers redeem their funds from the Earn program as quickly as possible,” Gemini said on Nov. 16, 2022. Gemini insisted that customer funds on Gemini could be redeemed at a 1:1 rate at any time and the exchange’s other products and services were normal. Gemini’s message was published the same day Genesis Global Capital detailed that it was pausing withdrawals and new loan originations. DCG founder Barry Silbert detailed in a letter to shareholders on Nov. 22 that it was important to note the lending arm of Genesis has had “no impact on Genesis’ spot and derivatives trading or custody businesses, which continue to operate as usual.” Silbert also reassured shareholders that his firm will “continue to be a leading builder of the industry.” What do you think about Genesis reportedly owing Gemini $900 million in funds?

"Biggest Movers: QNT Remains Near Multi-Week High, XMR up for Fifth Straight Session",Market Updates," Quant was one of the biggest gainers to start the weekend, as price remained close to a multi-week high. This comes as cryptocurrency markets were marginally higher, following Friday’s volatile session. Monero was also higher on Saturday, as the token extended its recent gains for a fifth consecutive day. Quant (QNT) was trading near a multi-week high on Saturday, as prices rallied above a notable resistance point. QNT/USD rose to an intraday high of $131.95 to start the weekend, less than a day after it fell to a bottom of $121.95. This surge in price pushed quant towards its highest point since Nov. 9, when price was trading at $150.60. Looking at the chart, today’s rally came as the token moved beyond a resistance at the $125.00 mark. In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is tracking at its strongest point since October 26, with a reading of 54.85. Although this is below a resistance of 55.00, many expect QNT to move beyond this over the weekend, with price moving towards $140.00. Monero (XMR) was another notable gainer on Saturday, as prices edged closer to a key ceiling. Following a low of $143.30 in yesterday’s session, XMR/USD moved to a peak of $148.19 earlier today. This saw monero hover close to a resistance point of $150.00, as bulls attempt to recapture a recent three-and-a-half-week high.

"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Consolidates to Start the Weekend",Market Updates," Bitcoin was consolidating to start the weekend, as prices once again fell below $17,000. The move comes as traders continued to digest the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. Ethereum was also marginally lower in today’s session, with price dropping below a key resistance point. Bitcoin (BTC) was consolidating to start the weekend, following the U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. Figures yesterday showed that 263,000 jobs were added to the American economy, better than the 200,000 markets had expected. This rise in jobs has left cryptocurrency markets unsure on what the Federal Reserve will do in its next policy meeting. BTC/USD slipped to a low of $16,877.88 following the news, which is lower than Friday’s peak of $17,116.04. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has also slipped, now tracking at 52.16, which is close to a floor of 52.00. Despite this, the 10-day (red) moving average has now fully crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which appears to be a signal of upcoming bullish momentum. Ethereum (ETH) was also in the red on Saturday, as the price of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency fell below a key resistance point. Following a high of $1,299.84 on Friday, ETH/USD fell to a low of $1,275.09 earlier in today’s session. This drop sees ethereum move below its recent ceiling at the $1,285 level, despite a recent upwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages. Looking at the chart, today’s drop came as the RSI fell below its long-term support point at 51.70. It is now tracking at 51.42, as of writing. Traders still seem to be optimistic about a potential move above $1,300, however, the RSI will likely need to surge beyond the 52.00 mark. Should this happen, and the momentum of the moving average climb higher, then we could see ETH move towards a ceiling of $1,370.

Stellantis Owned Fiat Launches Metaverse Store Using Touchcast and Microsoft Tech,Metaverse," Fiat, an automotive brand property of Stellantis, has launched its first metaverse-based store, which the company claims is the first showroom of its kind. The experience, which was developed with tech supplied by Touchcast and Microsoft, aims to make the virtual process of reviewing a car more interactive. Fiat, an automotive brand property of one of the top ten car manufacturers in the world, Stellantis, has launched its first virtual metaverse store. The company will allow customers to try the experience they will have inside and outside one of its models, the New 500 La Prima by Bocelli, through a virtual simulation of the model. The showroom will let the users review the car via a 360-degree view of the car model, and test the systems and the infotainment array that the company offers on this vehicle. Also, the customers can change the appearance and equipment of the car depending on the version and extras chosen, and even drive the vehicle through a virtual course. Olivier Francois, Fiat CEO and Global Stellantis CMO, remarked on the importance of this kind of experience for the development of the brand. He stated: The Fiat metaverse store is the first of its kind in the automotive sector. It is a magical experience: an immersive human-driven journey into the world of Fiat. Simple and user-friendly, pursuing the idea of ‘tech it easy,’ and accessible for everyone. To produce this experience, the company used Touchcast’s platform, which leverages Microsoft Cloud as a backbone to provide a headset-less metaverse experience. Other companies have also been testing such programs to expand the reach of their products far beyond what in-store car dealers can do. However, Fiat differentiates itself from other brands in allowing the customers to be accompanied by what it calls a “product genius,” an actual person who will be able to answer questions that the potential buyer will have about the capabilities of the vehicle and the specifics of the sale process. This does have a drawback, and that is that the metaverse showroom functions as a real showroom, not being available 24/7 for the customers. The brand plans to expand the number of models available in the showroom by the end of 2022, with more of the vehicles being available in the metaverse showroom in the first half of 2023. Stellantis did not specify if this tech will be extended to other brands in the company. Other automotive companies are also using the metaverse as part of their operations. Renault is using an industrial metaverse to optimize its production, aiming to save $330 million by 2025. In September, Ford filed 19 trademark applications to protect and develop its brand image in the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse store launched by Fiat?

Korean VC Firm Daesung Private Equity Announces $83 Million Metaverse Fund,Metaverse," Daesung Private Equity, a Korean venture capital firm, has announced the launch of a metaverse fund of 110 billion won ($83.5 million). The fund, which will have the participation of the Korean state represented by Korea Venture Investment Corporation’s Korea Fund of Funds, aims to put investments into virtual reality (VR) and digital twins-related businesses. Korean venture capital firm Daesung Private Equity has decided to get into the metaverse investment field. The company announced on Nov. 30 the launch of a metaverse-focused fund, that would have 110 billion won (equivalent to $83.5 million) to invest. The “Metaverse Scale-Up Fund,” which the company claims is Korea’s biggest private fund in the sector, will see the participation of the Korean state with the support of the Korea Venture Investment Corporation’s Korea Fund of Funds. 60 billion won (close to $46 million) was also injected by different companies of the Daesung consortium, including Daesung Holdings, Daesung Energy, and Daesung Clean Energy. Other institutions participating in the fund are the Industrial Bank of Korea and Shinhan Capital. The company, which has a background of investments in private IT firms, has a very favorable opinion about the future of the metaverse and strives to strike first with this move. On this, Daesung Group chairman Younghoon David Kim stated: Metaverse is already considered to be an industry-wide game changer rather than being simply a newly emerging field. Through this fund, Daesung Group will hold a strategic leadership position in the growth of the metaverse. The metaverse market seems to be on fertile ground in Asia, with a recent report issued by Deloitte estimating that the industry could add $1.4 trillion to Asia’s GDP annually by 2035. Daesung Private Equity wants to have the first-mover advantage, and that is why this is the biggest fund of the 16 funds administered by the company, which holds 407.6 billion won ($312 million). The Korean state has also been putting funds into the metaverse, announcing investments of $177 million in May as part of the Digital New Deal, a national, tech-focused plan. At that time, Korea was one of the first nations to invest directly in metaverse companies. Furthermore, in June, the Ministry of South Korean Science, Information and Communications Technology was recruiting companies to be part of a metaverse content creation project, directed to lay the groundwork for the strategy of the country in this area. What do you think about the metaverse fund launched by Daesung Private Equity? Tell us in the comments section below.

EU Parliament to ‘Vote on Adopting the Regulation on MiCA’ — Expert Says Industry...,Regulation," In a recent statement, the European Parliament said its members would shortly “vote on adopting the regulation on markets in crypto-assets (MiCA).” According to the parliamentary body’s think tank, the envisaged regulations are expected to provide “legal certainty for crypto-assets not covered by existing EU legislation.” A crypto counselor, Paulius Vaitkevicius, said any regulation of crypto is likely to result in more capital and talent coming into the space. After months of discussions and negotiations which culminated in the June 30 preliminary agreement, the European Parliament (EP) is now set to “vote on adopting the regulation on markets in crypto-assets (MiCA).” The vote is set to take place during the legislative body’s plenary session. European leaders assert that the adoption of MiCA will lead to the creation of “harmonized rules for crypto-assets at [the] E.U. level.” According to a Nov. 29 briefing by the parliament’s think tank, the harmonized crypto rules are expected to provide “legal certainty for crypto-assets not covered by existing EU legislation.” In the briefing, the EP also argues that the rules will not only enhance the protection of consumers and investors but will also “promote innovation and use of crypto-assets.” Through MICA, European authorities also hope “to regulate [the] issuance and trading of crypto-assets as well as the management of the underlying assets.” While European leaders like European Central Bank president Christine Largade are pushing for tougher regulation — MiCA II — some critics of the proposed legislation argue that the envisaged regulations in their current form may stifle innovation.       
Legal Clarity Attracts Mature Players
Commenting on the European Union’s drive to regulate cryptocurrencies, Paulius Vaitkevicius, founder and crypto counselor at the law firm VILP Solutions, said the prevailing “Wild West environment” is not helpful to all parties. He also told Bitcoin.com News that without guidelines or regulatory frameworks “and with a number of situations where industry players collapse, we might end up in a situation where we will have only a handful of investors left in the industry.”

Therefore, to stop this from happening the crypto industry needs legal clarity, which according to Vaitkevicius, “bring[s] in more mature players to the industry from both project and investor sides.” Explaining why he is in favor of regulating the industry, Vaitkevicius said:
From my personal experience, such players have been seeking regulations and clarity already for some time and waiting for the right moment to step in properly. With regulations, we will see these firm steps and as a result additional capital and talent coming to the industry space.
Meanwhile, some crypto opponents have said if appropriate regulatory frameworks were already in place, Sam Bankman-Fried’s shenanigans would have been exposed much earlier. However, when asked about the validity of this argument, Vaitkevicius said the opinion that on paper FTX itself was “one of the most regulated players in the industry” undermines this theory. He added:
“Regulation is a good step forward, but [this] needs to be followed by other elements to be functional in real-life situations and achieve the pursued goals.”
