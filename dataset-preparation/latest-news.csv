"Bitcoin’s Third Largest Wallet Changed Hands, but Onchain Data Shows It’s Likely the Same...",Featured," Last year and during the first half of 2022, speculators assumed the third-largest bitcoin address was a ‘mysterious whale,’ even though the wallet had shown strong characteristics of being a cryptocurrency exchange. The address known as “1P5ZED” has since been replaced by another address, after the wallet started to transfer its entire bitcoin balance in mid-July 2022. The bitcoin address “1LQoW” is now the third-largest wallet today, and it’s very likely that the owner of the 1LQoW wallet is the same entity that managed the 1P5ZED wallet.  After bitcoin’s price soared to new heights in November 2021, there was a significant amount of speculation concerning the third-largest bitcoin wallet known as “1P5ZED.” Rumors about the wallet plagued social media and some people erroneously attributed the wallet to Microstrategy’s stash of BTC. Then after the rumors were debunked, blockchain observers noticed that 1P5ZED moved all of its bitcoins in mid-July. Blockchain records show that by the end of June 2022, the 1P5ZED address was down to 0.01257 BTC. In 2021, when Bitcoin.com News reported on 1P5ZED, a source with “access to blockchain analytics tools (Chainalysis and Ciphertrace) as part of their job function” told our newsdesk: There is an almost 100% chance that both addresses in your article, both 1P5ZED and 1FzWLk, belong to Gemini. The 1P5ZED wallet also had shown signs of exchange spending patterns like cluster spending. Furthermore, the block explorer oxt.me highlights two annotations, which assume that the “1P5ZED” bitcoin address may have been tied to the exchange Bittrex. However, following the mid-July and end-of-June removal of more than 132,000 BTC, data still indicates that the wallet is still likely associated with the crypto exchange Gemini. Even if analysts cannot identify the exact owner of 1P5ZED, onchain data, clustering, and heuristics show that 1P5ZED simply changed hands (addresses), but the owner remains the same. The third largest bitcoin wallet today, “1LQoW” has a balance of more than 140,000 BTC, and the wallet is connected to 1P5ZED and “1FzWLk.” As we noted in our prior reports, 1FzWLk transacted with 1P5ZED on numerous occasions and it transacted with 1LQoW as well. It seems that the now empty 1FzWLk wallet dispersed the funds to other addresses including 1LQoW. Data further shows that 1FzWLk’s transactions were often connected with known Gemini exchange wallets and the current third richest bitcoin wallet today 1LQoW. Per usual, social media posts and crypto publications identified 1LQoW as a new ‘mystery whale’ or new mega player in the market. OXT researcher Ergo BTC, tweeted about the address in July and August 2022. “1LQoW was first seen a few weeks ago, receiving its first [transaction] in a batch withdrawal from Coinbase,” Ergo tweeted on July 19. “It’s 2 outgoing [transactions] are back to 1FzWL, which implies that this address is at least linked and possibly co-owned by 1P5Zs/1FzWL/key rotation? In other words not ‘selling.’” Speculating on whether or not it was Coinbase Custody, Ergo wrote: Coinbase Custody: Pros: By adjacency and first inflows into 1LQoW. Cons: The first seen on 1FzWL doesn’t quite align with the Coinbase Custody announcement. Ergo also spoke about the bitcoin wallet 1LQoW on Aug. 2, 2022, when a lot of speculative reporting started to rise after the 1P5ZED myths prior. “Crypto tabloids and clickbaiters have gone from ‘1P5Z is dumping all his coins’ to ‘1LQoW is a new whale that bought $1.64B out of nowhere. ’lmao,” Ergo tweeted. Onchain data also confirms that 1LQoW is not a new ‘mega whale’ or ‘market player’ that just suddenly took the third-largest bitcoin wallet reigns from 1P5ZED. 1LQoW is most likely an American-based crypto custodian or exchange, and we can’t say for 100% certain that it is a Gemini-associated BTC wallet. Cons include the fact that the wallet does not match Gemini’s bitcoin reserve data hosted on cryptoquant.com and other reserve data sites like Glassnode. The stats from cryptoquant.com’s Gemini-associated bitcoin reserve data shows Gemini’s stash is around 136,923 BTC. The third-largest BTC address 1LQoW holds approximately 140,664 BTC (as of 2:00 p.m. ET on Dec. 4, 2022). Coinglass.com data shows Gemini’s BTC reserves stash is estimated to be around 132,102 BTC today, which is also a discrepancy. What do you think about the relationship between wallets 1P5ZED, 1FzWLk, and the current third-largest bitcoin wallet 1LQoW?

Web3 Crypto Onboarding Platform Transak Integrates With Coinbase Wallet,Wallets," According to Transak, users of the Coinbase self-custody wallet in South East Asia can now use its Web3 onboarding platform “as a fiat on-ramp to buy crypto.” Transak’s integration with the Coinbase wallet is coming at a time when more users are becoming “aware of the importance of keeping their assets safe, secure, and in their control.” Transak, a Web3 onboarding infrastructure provider, recently said that users of the Coinbase wallet can now use its platform “as a fiat on-ramp to buy crypto.” According to a statement, the integration “eases [the] onboarding” of users in Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and the Philippines. As per a Nov. 29 statement, the Coinbase wallet integration announcement followed Transak’s reported recent addition of local payment methods that enable users in the two countries to overcome barriers to non-custodial wallets. In the Philippines, users can now buy crypto on Transak using local payment methods such as Gcash, Maya, and Grabpay or through debit and credit cards. Similarly, users in Thailand can buy crypto on Transak with their debit and credit cards and through bank transfers as well. Commenting on the Coinbase wallet integration with Transak, Hassan Ahmed, the regional director at Coinbase in Southeast Asia (SEA), sought to highlight the growing importance of users controlling their own funds. He said: Self-hosted wallets are on the rise, especially as more people become aware of the importance of keeping their assets safe, secure, and in their control. Coinbase Wallet, with its world-class security and ease of use, now integrated with Transak makes it even easier for SEA customers to access crypto and Web3 with peace of mind. For his part, Sami Start, the co-founder and CEO of Transak, said his platform’s integration with Coinbase makes it “more intuitive for users to participate.” On the other hand, the inclusion of local payment methods means users in these regions can onboard more efficiently while incurring “lesser transaction fees overall.” What are your thoughts on this story?

"The Crypto 6 Case Heads to Trial With Only 1 Defendant Left, Prosecutor’s So-Called...",News," On Dec. 6, 2022, the “Crypto Six” case will be heading to trial, and out of all six defendants, only Ian Freeman, co-host of the radio broadcast Free Talk Live, has not accepted a plea bargain. According to the most recent hearing, Freeman’s legal counsel filed a Daubert motion, which aims to exclude the government’s expert testimony, as it’s been argued that private firms and closed-source software used in blockchain analysis don’t meet the Daubert standards of admissible evidence. Roughly 20 months ago on March 16, 2021, federal agents raided the Free Talk Live studio, the Bitcoin Embassy, and Shire Free Church in Keene New Hampshire. At the time, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged six New Hampshire residents for operating a cryptocurrency exchange business without the proper permission. The DOJ “Crypto Six” indictment “alleges that the defendants knowingly operated the crypto exchange business in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations.” Since then out of all six individuals, Ian Freeman, co-host of the radio broadcast Free Talk Live and libertarian activist, is the only person that remains in the case. Freeman is taking the case to a jury and the trial begins on Dec. 6, 2022. Freeman told Bitcoin.com News this week that it was revealed prosecutors are dropping all fraud-related charges against Freeman prior to trial. He also said that jury selection will start on the sixth as well, and the trial will start immediately after jurors are selected, which is expected to take two weeks. Freeman discussed the subject with Bitcoin.com News and explained that his legal team filed a Daubert motion meant to exclude the testimony of the FBI’s top blockchain ‘expert.’ He said that since the U.S. government relied on private companies and closed-source software it doesn’t meet the Daubert standards of admissible evidence.       
“The feds then scrambled to have the ‘expert’ re-do the analysis using the blockchain.com explorer, which they call ‘open source,’ even though it’s just open for public use, not open source,” Freeman said. “This is a tacit admission that they know Chainalysis’ findings would not pass legal muster and it would be denied as evidence in a trial,” he added.
The Free Talk Live co-host continued:
Furthermore, my attorney questioned the FBI’s top blockchain ‘expert’ Erin Montgomery and got her to admit that she’s not even a computer scientist. She has a liberal arts degree and admitted that anyone can do what she did, which disqualifies her as an ‘expert.’ The prosecution will be prohibited from presenting her as any sort of expert at trial.
According to the web portal thecrypto6.com, supporters will be protesting outside the courthouse on Dec. 12, 2022. Mainstream media is anticipated to attend and Freeman told our newsdesk that the team is trying to get an audio feed of the trial online. “Presently, we are awaiting approval from the judge on that,” Freeman detailed.
For more details on the charges that were dropped and the charges that remain, check out the summary from freekeene.com here.

"Addresses That Sat Idle for Years Transferred 1,221 Bitcoins Worth $20M Over the Last...",News," During the last seven days, bitcoin’s price has remained above the $16K region following the aftermath of FTX’s collapse. Since then, a number of ‘sleeping bitcoins’ that sat idle for five to nine years have been moving during the last four days. Bitcoins that were worth far less back then are being transferred for the first time in years. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has remained steady during the last seven days, ranging between $16,150 to $16,995 per unit, and a brief jump over the $17K zone. Over the last four days, while BTC prices are much lower than they were at the start of November, hundreds of old bitcoins have been on the move. For instance, two owners spent 348 bitcoin on Nov. 29, 2022, and the stash was once worth $348,000. We can’t really tell whether or not the transferred coins were sold, but they were spent from addresses created almost six years ago. Heuristics also indicate that out of the 348 bitcoin that sat dormant since March 2017, 299 of that BTC likely belonged to the same owner. The 348 BTC is worth roughly 5.8 million nominal U.S. dollars using current BTC exchange rates. One owner controlled “17HxA,” an address created on March 29, 2017, and it spent 48.88 BTC at block height 765,168. Coincidently, five more transactions, from addresses created at the end of March 2017, spent 59.99 BTC in each transaction at block heights 765,169, 765,184, 765,185, 765,187, and 765,190. On the same day, blockchain parsers from btcparser.com caught a 173.61 BTC spend from an idle address created on June 14, 2017, and another 100 BTC spend from an address created on April 12, 2014. The 100 bitcoin sat in an address idle for close to nine years, and at the time, each BTC was worth less than $500 per unit. Following these old spends, a transaction from an address first seen close to ten years ago, on April 26, 2013, beat all the spends transacted on Nov. 29, 2022. The transaction took place on Dec. 2, 2022, and the wallet “1EaAv” spent 600 so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins.’ The 600 BTC was worth around $84,000 on April 26, 2013, and today the coins that were spent at block height 765,644, are worth roughly $10.14 million using current BTC exchange rates. Data shows that out of all the bitcoins spent since Nov. 29, which slept for roughly five to nine years, all of them combined were worth less than $800K in value at the time the original addresses were created. Using exchange rates today, the 1,221.45 BTC that stemmed from ‘sleeping bitcoin’ addresses equates to around $20 million. Old holders are moving bitcoins that sat dormant for five to nine years, while current bitcoin prices are at the lowest values in two years. What do you think about the so-called ‘sleeping bitcoin’ addresses that have spent roughly $20 million in bitcoin during the last few days?

Bitget Shares Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves to Enhance Transparency Users’ Assets Safeguarded With...,Sponsored," Leading global cryptocurrency exchange, Bitget, announces today that it is launching its Proof of Reserves Page, which will demonstrate to users that we are a full-reserve exchange, as supported by its Proof of Reserves (“PoR”), using the cryptographic-audited Merkle tree method, and that users’ assets stored on the platform are safeguarded. The Proof of Reserves page provides users with a wealth of information on the topic, including several core elements such as “Merkle Validator”, the monthly snapshots presenting the balance of the reserve pools, user education on Proof of Reserves and the importance of being fully reserved, as well as how the Merkle tree supports and proves the authenticity and consistency of the data presented by Bitget. Snapshots of reserve wallets on the platform and the user’s assets serve as reassuring evidence and demonstrate that their assets are held at least at a 1:1 ratio. To further enhance transparency and ensure the accuracy of the information on the page, Bitget is also launching a new tool, “Merkle Validator”, for users to perform self-audit with their own accounts. The feature allows users to verify the security of their funds in a few simple steps. Users are able to verify the status of their assets’ “Merkle leaf” under the Merkle tree data structure. Bitget is also committed to carrying out regular audits of the PoRs to make sure the balances and the status of user assets within its reserves stay up-to-date. Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget, comments, “Bitget actively responds to the market concerns, and even before FTX filed for bankruptcy, on Nov 9th, we had already promised to publish our Merkle tree Proof-of-Reserves within a month’s time. Today, we are proud to fulfil our promise. The release of the Proof of Reserves and the Merkle tree data equips users with updated and informational insights on the financial status of Bitget and enhanced control on their assets stored on the platform, which is echoed in our commitment of maximum transparency and top-notch protection policies for users.” “The crypto industry is under close scrutiny after the scandals and collapses of some giant crypto firms. The desire of users to invest and store assets on a secure platform has seen its high, as Bitget has witnessed an increase in users recently. With the rollout of the Proof of Reserves page, Bitget not only demonstrates well-rounded protection for users, but also will continue to advocate more initiatives aiming to offer safe adoption of cryptocurrency worldwide and a sustainable and trustworthy environment in the crypto universe,” adds Gracy. Aside from the POR release, Bitget has launched various initiatives to help rebuild the market’s confidence, such as launching the USD 5 million Builders Fund for users affected by the FTX incident, increasing the Protection Fund to USD 300 million, and most recently, investing 20 million in a series of campaigns with Lionel Messi. What is Proof of Reserves? Proof of Reserves refers to an auditing procedure that is verifiable through cryptographic proofs, checks of public wallet ownership, and recurring audits to certify the holdings of an exchange. The custodian provides transparency and proof of the existence of on-chain reserves and that the total amounts of those coins held and effectively at the disposal of the platform exceeds or is equal to the sum of all users’ holdings of those coins. To achieve this, Bitget stores the hash of each user’s account assets in a leaf node on the Merkle tree. Each user can verify that their funds are included in the Merkle tree by checking the total amount of users’ assets stored in the Merkle tree leaf nodes. The open-source code of the platform’s proof of its 100% solvency program has also been published to GitHub. About Bitget Bitget, established in 2018, is the world’s top five leading cryptocurrency exchange with innovative products and social trading services as its key features, currently serving over 8 million users in more than 100 countries around the world. The exchange is committed to providing one-stop and secure trading solutions to users and aims to increase crypto adoption by collaborations with creditable partners, including Argentinian legendary footballer Lionel Messi, Italian leading football team Juventus, PGL Major’s official esports crypto partner, and the leading esports organization Team Spirit.

Nobel Prize Laureate Paul Krugman Warns of an Eternal Winter for Blockchain,News," Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has warned about the possibility of a perennial winter for blockchain projects, including crypto. In a recent article published in the New York Times (NYT), the economist criticizes blockchain as a tech and its uses citing several signs that he believes precede this upcoming winter. Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize award winner, is warning about an upcoming eternal cryptocurrency winter for blockchain-based projects, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency networks. In an NYT opinion piece published on Dec. 1, the economist discusses the real utility of this tech, and how there are already signs that predict a future downfall. Krugman criticizes the real utility of this technology when there are other centralized alternatives that currently function quite well. On this, Krugman explained his skepticism, stating: What’s the point?” Why go to the trouble and expense of maintaining a ledger in many places, and basically carrying that ledger around every time a transaction takes place? With base on this, and also on the recent downfall of one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, FTX, Krugman believes that this crypto winter might bring a complete abandonment of blockchain and crypto tech. He compared it to the Fimbulwinter, a winter that precedes the end of the world according to nordic mythology. To Krugman, in the last few months, there have been several signs of this abandonment coming. The economist cites the recent write-off that several companies like Maersk and the Australian Stock Exchange have made regarding their blockchain-based projects as part of its justification. Also, Krugman criticizes Bitcoin’s raison d’être openly, stating that “banks rarely steal their customers’ assets, while crypto institutions more easily succumb to the temptation, and extreme inflation that destroys money’s value generally happens only amid political chaos.” In the same vein, Krugman calls out Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, estimating the damage that it had brought to the environment in the tens of billions of dollars, with no apparent benefit besides producing “worthless tokens.” However, this opinion is different from the one that he expressed on May 2021. At the time, he expressed that while he did not believe in the fundamentals behind Bitcoin, he was sure that the market was a “cult that can survive indefinitely.” In June, he compared cryptocurrencies to the housing bubble and the subprime mortgage crisis, telling “it is a house built not on sand, but on nothing at all.” What do you think about the opinion of Paul Krugman on the future of blockchain and crypto?

"Report: AAX Users Storm Crypto Exchange’s Nigerian Offices, Attack Employees",News," Nigeria users of the crypto exchange AAX, which suspended withdrawals on Nov. 12, reportedly stormed its offices in Lagos and began assaulting employees. Reports that disgruntled AAX users have harassed the crypto exchange’s workers came just days after the Nigerian crypto and blockchain advocacy group asked to refrain from doing so. Meanwhile, the former vice president of AAX claimed in a tweet that the “brand is no more and trust is broken.” According to a local report, a group of disgruntled Nigerian users of Atom Asset Exchange (AAX) recently stormed the crypto exchange’s offices in Lagos and assaulted employees. The angry mob reportedly demanded the lifting of a freeze on withdrawals, which came into effect on Nov. 12. While the Dec. 2 report by Legit does not state when the incident occurred, it nonetheless corroborates an earlier plea made by the advocacy group the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN).In its Nov. 28 public notice, SIBAN urged AAX users to stop victimizing the beleaguered crypto exchange’s workers. We appeal to and discourage any dissatisfied or angry user or investor from harassing or victimizing the AAX Country Manager (Nigeria), other local staff members, and AAX ambassadors nationwide. These persons are also facing the same situation as disgruntled users and investors are. The advocacy group also revealed that the Hong-Kong headquartered crypto exchange’s senior executives had stopped communicating with their Nigeria-based workers. Meanwhile, in a message aimed at AAX and its founders, the advocacy group reminded the crypto exchange of its obligations towards users. In addition, the notice suggested some steps that AAX and Nigerian workers must take to restore the public’s trust. “If protecting users is AAX’s highest priority as it boasts in its public announcement, AAX should immediately take steps to close the gaps by bridging communication between itself and its local staff in Nigeria on the one hand, and between AAX and its Nigerian users on the other hand,” SIBAN’s public notice said. In its last update (Nov. 18), AAX told users that there had been “many new developments” which meant it required “more time to respond to the overwhelming amount of questions in the community.” At the time, AAX said it would issue more updates via the official channel for public announcements and updates. However, the crypto exchange had not issued fresh updates at the time of writing (Dec. 3, 11:00 am EST). Dear all, it’s true I have resigned from AAX. I did fight for the community but none of the initiatives we came up with were accepted. Any role I had left for communication became hollow.  1/4 — ₿en Caselin HODL (@BenCaselin) November 28, 2022  The sudden resignation of the crypto platform’s vice president Ben Caselin and his claims that the “brand is no more and trust is broken” have fueled speculation that the crypto exchange might not resume operations any time soon.

Demand for Cryptocurrency Miners Rises in Russia Amid Low Prices of Hardware,Mining," Russia’s market for specialized crypto mining equipment has been seeing high demand over the past couple of months, with buyers attracted by the low price tags. Russian experts also predict an increase in the supply of used coin minting hardware as large foreign companies leave the industry. Demand for powerful computing devices designed to mint bitcoin has surged in Russia during the fourth quarter of the year, spurred by their low prices amid declining crypto markets, the Russian business daily Kommersant reported. The country’s cheap electricity rates and expectations for a higher supply of second-hand miners have played a role as well. The positive trend in the market for ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners, used to extract bitcoin, has been observed despite a recent decrease in demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), or video cards employed to validate transactions for other cryptocurrencies, experts from the industry told the newspaper. The sales of mining hardware retailer Chilkoot in the first two months of Q4 exceeded those for the entire third quarter. And the total for the previous nine months of 2022 was 65% higher than last year’s volume. The daily also quoted Bitriver, one of Russia’s largest mining operators, which said that in the first 10 months of this year the demand for miners grew by 1.5 times. “We work with legal entities and they began to buy 30% more equipment per transaction than at the beginning of the year,” noted Artem Eremin, Chilkoot’s development manager. He added that the prices of GPUs started falling in the second half of September and are still declining, citing Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake mining as a major reason. If before The Merge video cards were bought by miners in huge quantities, now demand comes mostly from gamers, acknowledged Roman Kaufman, co-founder of Berezka DAO and Weezi. The crypto entrepreneur confirmed that ASICs are now gaining “huge popularity” in the Russian Federation. Industrial mining enterprises in Russia can take advantage of the current market conditions, said Bitriver’s Financial Analyst Vladislav Antonov, who also pointed out that the increase in demand is due to decrease in wholesale prices. The cost of mining hardware decreased by almost 20% between August and October, he revealed. Russia’s relatively low electricity rates, compared to many other regions in the world, is another factor supporting demand for crypto miners, according to Terracrypto’s founder Nikita Vassev. Despite the low valuations in the crypto market, with bitcoin (BTC) hovering in the range of $16,000 – $17,000, Russian mining firms still have some margin of safety, noted 51ASIC co-founder Mikhail Brezhnev. When using the latest models of coin minting machines to mine at just $0.07 per 1 kWh, the production cost of 1 bitcoin is around $11,000. The picture could improve further for crypto mining businesses in Russia due to the expected influx of used mining equipment. As Brezhnev explained, many mining companies, mainly foreign-based and financed by borrowed capital or clients, have failed to optimize their activities and may go out of business amid the current bear market. He believes their mining machines will most likely be bought in bulk by others who want to enter the industry. The comments of the experts interviewed by Kommersant come after earlier reports revealed a significant growth in revenue and electricity consumption in Russia’s mining sector over a period of several years. However, this year’s crypto winter and sanctions imposed in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine hurt crypto miners in Russia and some foreign investors have already pulled out of the country. Do you think the prices of ASIC miners in the Russian market will continue to fall? Share your expectations in the comments section below.

Maxine Waters Criticized for Praising SBF — Lawmaker Says ‘We Appreciate That You’ve Been...,Regulation," Congresswoman Maxine Waters has been heavily criticized for saying that she appreciates former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) being candid in his discussions about the collapse of his crypto exchange, FTX. “SBF has not, in fact, been candid in his discussions. He committed fraud, full stop,” one critic stressed. Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), chairwoman of the House Committee on Financial Services, was slammed on social media after she tweeted her appreciation to former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) Friday. Waters is leading a congressional hearing on the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which will begin on Dec. 13. The lawmaker wrote: “We appreciate that you’ve been candid in your discussions about what happened at FTX. Your willingness to talk to the public will help the company’s customers, investors, and others. To that end, we would welcome your participation in our hearing on the 13th.”  Many people quickly pointed out to Waters that the former FTX chief executive is a fraud and should be arrested on sight. Some people have even compared Bankman-Fried and the FTX implosion to Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. “If you don’t arrest him I will have lost all faith in our government being the tiniest bit of just,” bitcoin proponent Dan Held replied to Waters. Lawyer Jake Chervinsky responded to the congresswoman: “Rep. Waters, we appreciate that you’re holding a hearing on the 13th, and we look forward to substantive fact-finding about what happened at FTX.” He added: I am certain that factfinding will show that SBF has not, in fact, been candid in his discussions. He committed fraud, full stop. However, many people are not surprised by Waters’ tweet given her good relations with Bankman-Fried. At the conclusion of a congressional hearing last year, she even appeared to be blowing kisses at SBF. Some people also pointed out that the former FTX executive gave $300K to Waters’ committee members. Crypto exchange FTX collapsed and filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11. An estimated one million customers and investors lost billions of dollars in the meltdown. FTX is currently being investigated by authorities in multiple jurisdictions. In the U.S., the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other regulators are investigating the exchange for mishandling customer funds, among other charges. Jeremy Hogan, a partner at Hogan & Hogan, told Waters: You, as the chairwoman (or the Committee itself), can just subpoena him to testify. No need to ask nicely on Twitter. It’s House Rule XI clause 2(m). But I’m sure you already knew that. Bankman-Fried was the second-largest donor to the Democratic Party during the 2021-22 election cycle. According to Opensecrets, he donated $39,884,256 to Democrats before FTX imploded and had to file for bankruptcy. However, Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk believes that SBF’s actual support to Democrats was over $1 billion. What do you think about the statement by Rep. Maxine Waters about Bankman-Fried and do you think she should lead the investigation into the collapse of FTX? Let us know in the comments section below.
